# TODO

* Support for on-the-fly-signing or check how to do it;
* Ratelimiting? server side (RRL).

## Nice to have

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 75/80K qps on
    moderate hardware;
* privatekey.Precompute() when signing?
* Last remaining RRs: APL, ATMA, A6, KEY, SIG and NXT;
* CAA parsing is broken.
